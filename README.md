# NFC-Hall-Ticket
NFC Based Secure Hall Ticket System


Abstract:Hall Tickets are the medium of entry for a candidate seeking candidature in any examination held in India. Unfortunately owing to their insufficient proficiency many candidates seek the help of other illegal personalities in order to successfully crack the examination. The proposed solution uses cutting edge technology to ensure that identity fraud is overcome successfully. The system suggested does away with the traditional hall tickets embedding them with an NFC (Near Field Communication) tag and scanning the NFC tag as a medium of verification of the identity of the candidate.


Introduction:In present day Indian education system, Hall Tickets are awarded to the candidate along with the identity cards of the institution they are a part of as an indication and verification of their identity to enter the examination hall. Many of the times these identity cards and the hall tickets are forged to illegally represent a false identity of the candidate. The aim of the proposed system is to identify these loopholes and plug them where ever possible. The system consists of an Android application which scans the NFC tag embedded onto the hall ticket. The contents of the NFC tag are a unique ID which serves as a primary key to extract the details of the student from the database. These details along with the photograph of the candidate are matched with those on the hall ticket manually. Based on the discretion of the Examination authority the candidate is allowed or not allowed.
